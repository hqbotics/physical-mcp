# ChatGPT GPT Action Wrapper (No MCP Required)

ChatGPT doesn't support MCP tool servers directly, so use this GPT Action wrapper over the HTTP Vision API.

## 1) Start physical-mcp with Vision API enabled

Vision API is on by default (`vision_api.enabled: true`) and serves on port `8090`.

## 2) Expose HTTPS endpoint

ChatGPT Actions require HTTPS. Use `physical-mcp tunnel` (or Cloudflare/ngrok) and copy the public URL.

## 3) Create GPT Action

1. Open ChatGPT GPT Builder
2. Go to **Actions** → **Add action**
3. Paste `gpt-action/openapi.yaml`
4. Replace `https://YOUR-PHYSICAL-MCP-HOST` with your HTTPS endpoint
5. Save

## 4) Recommended Action policy

- Use `/scene` first for lightweight context
- Use `/changes?wait=true` for non-blocking monitoring
- Pull `/frame/{camera_id}` only when visual confirmation is required
- Use `/health` if monitoring quality appears degraded (provider/backoff visibility)
- Use `/alerts` for replay after reconnects or missed turns
- Keep polling interval >= 10s to reduce load

## Troubleshooting

- **No events in `/alerts` after reconnect**
  - Check `since` cursor isn't in the future.
  - Retry without `since` to confirm baseline replay works.
  - Invalid `since` values are ignored by the API (treated as no cursor).
  - Example: `GET /alerts?event_type=startup_warning` to confirm fallback-mode warnings are being recorded.
- **Monitoring appears stale**
  - Call `/health` and check `status`, `consecutive_errors`, `backoff_until`.
  - If degraded/backoff persists, verify provider key/model/network in MCP config.
  - Example: `GET /alerts?event_type=provider_error&limit=5` to correlate health degradation with provider failures.
  - Per-camera drilldown example: `GET /alerts?since=<last_seen>&camera_id=usb:0&event_type=provider_error&limit=10`
  - Replay order is deterministic: oldest→newest by `timestamp` (tie-break by `event_id`).
  - `since` is exclusive: events exactly at the cursor timestamp are not returned.
  - Normalized-input example: `GET /alerts?camera_id=%20usb:0%20&event_type=PROVIDER_ERROR&limit=1`
  - Mixed-edge example: `GET /alerts?since=not-a-time&camera_id=%20usb:0%20&event_type=PROVIDER_ERROR&limit=1`
  - `event_type` matching is case-insensitive (including replayed events with uppercase or space-padded stored types), and surrounding spaces in `camera_id` are ignored.
  - Replay filtering also tolerates legacy stored rows where `camera_id` or `event_type` were space-padded/mixed-case.
  - `/changes` has the same camera-id normalization; invalid `since` values are ignored there too.
  - Example: `GET /changes?since=bad-cursor&camera_id=%20usb:0%20`
- **Frame fetch fails for a camera**
  - Verify camera id from `/scene` keys.
  - Expect JSON errors like `camera_not_found` when ids mismatch.

## Notes

- This wrapper is read-only by design for safety.
- For full watch-rule automation, use MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, OpenClaw).
- For operator incident response flow, see `docs/health-alerts-debug-playbook.md`.
